This was a fun project where I ran the smaller version of object detection model yolov8 on the tello drone. This was easy done through the python package offered by djitellopy. Beside that you just need to download the model weights (of any model to your preference and it doesn't have to be yolov8). As you can see in the output_example images, yolov8 performed very well on the tello drone, even when the images are blurry due to instability, bad lighting condition and motion.
